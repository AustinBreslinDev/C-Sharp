# C-Sharp Demonstrations
--
## Introduction
This repository is just for me to learn and to demonstarte what I have learned
while at the same time making sure that I have some notes of what I learned that
I can always go back to as a point of reference. The first solution in this
repository will be C# on Linux, as I prefer the Linux OS over the Windows OS.

Points for that statement. Windows 10 has a lot of telementry going on while the
Linux distributions do not have any, or they have opt-out options that actually
work. That is not to say that I don't have a Windows OS on my machine, because I
do and I use that when a technology is Windows OS specific such as the .net framework or Universal Windows Programs (UWP).

## About Me and C#
I started working with C# in April 2017 for my current company and I am still learning 
C#, but I do have an advantage here over starters, I worked with Java EE for my
current company for the past 3 years.
